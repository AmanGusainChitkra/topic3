    <h2 class="strip">IoT Apps</h2><br>
    <p class="strip2">Iot apps are a collection of services and software that compiles data recieved from connected devices. 
      <br>They runs on IoT devices and generally use machine learning to analyze large amount of sensor data in the cloud. 
      <br>For example home automation(i.e installing smart technologies like door locks, smoke detectors etc.), 
      <br>supply chain management, environmental monitoring etc. Most important features of IoT apps are real time operating systems,  
      <br>remote connectivity, data analyzation.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="strip">Smart Building</h2><br>
    <p class="strip2">
      <br>Smart Buildings allow us to do some tasks like control  building temperature, security, maintenance etc. using 
      <br>mobile devices and computers. It includes installation and use of integrated and advanced building automation system. 
      <br>It uses IoT solutions for common issues and smart operations help reduce wasted staff time. As a part of automation, 
      <br>AI cameras are installed for face recognition, smoke detectors for harmful gases detection and a secure network 
      <br>connection. The main features needed are high security, self sustainaibility and centralized connectivity.

    </p><br>
    <h2 class="strip">Control Interface</h2><br>
    <p class="strip2">
      <br>For the control interface, the main high-level features are full-fledged GUI control which contains automated lighting, 
      <br>energy efficiency control, building usage insights. It also has some AI-controlled features such as optimum temperature 
      <br>control, humidity control, clean air management, resource optimization etc. The users include recognizable user 
      <br>(users recognized by the AI camera), and unrecognizable users. The main parts needed are a reliable internet connection, 
      <br>some sensors like PR motion sensor, smoke sensor etc, computing devices like microprocessors etc.
